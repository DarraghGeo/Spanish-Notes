# Relative Pronouns
## Use

## Form
When the pronoun follows a preposition you must use the definite article

 - Las mujers con las que estaba hablando. => The women with whom he was speaking.

Or, when referrring to people, use _quien_ in place of _que_.
 - Las mujers con quienes estaba hablando.

## Note
The neuter form _Lo que_ can be used to refer to the previous part of the sentence, as opposed to just a noun.


# Interrogative
## Use
Used to ask questions.

## Form
The interrogative pronouns are

 - ¿Qué? => What?
 - ¿Cúal? => Which?
 - ¿Quién? => Who?
 - ¿De quién? => Whose?
 - ¿Cuanto? => How much?

## Note
Use _¿Qué?_ when asking someone to define, explain or classify something, or if it is immediately followed by a noun. Otherwise, use _¿Cuál?_

When _¿Quién?_ is the object of a verb it becomes _¿A quién?_
