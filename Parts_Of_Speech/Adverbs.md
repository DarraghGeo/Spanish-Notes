# Adverbs

## Use
To further describer verbs or adjectives.
- He speaks _slowly_.

## Form
Regular adverbs are formed by adding _-mente_ onto the feminine singular form of the equivelent adjective.
 - _Lento_ becomes Lentamente
  - Habla muy lentamente => He speaks very slowly.

Placement:
 - After the verb
 - Before the verb for emphasis.
 - Before the adjective it connects with.

## Note
Adverbs that are the same as their adjective equivelent do not agree with anything.
