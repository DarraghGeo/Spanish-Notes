# Spanish-Notes

Included in this repository are my Spanish grammar notes.

Notes:
 - These Spanish notes are for Latin American Spanish (more specfically Colombian), as such the Vosotros conjugations are not included as they are not commonly used in Latin America.
 - In the conjugation tables a minus (-) before a verb ending indicates the conjugated ending is added to the end of the __root__ of the verb (the verb without the ar/er/ir at the end), while a plus (+) indicates the conjugation ending is added onto the end of the complete infinitive.

Feel free to use, modify, pull, push and whatever you want with them.
