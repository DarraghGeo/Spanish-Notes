# Spanish-Notes

Included in this repository are my Spanish grammar notes.

Notes
=====
 - These Spanish notes are for Latin American Spanish (more specfically Colombian), as such the Vosotros conjugations are not included as they are not commonly used in Latin America.
 - In the conjugation tables a minus (-) before a verb ending indicates the conjugated ending is added to the end of the __root__ of the verb (the verb without the ar/er/ir at the end), while a plus (+) indicates the conjugation ending is added onto the end of the complete infinitive.

Misc.
=====

Vos
---
In Medellín, and maybe other parts of Colombia and Latin America in general, the _Vos_ conjugation is used among close friends instead of  _Tú_.

To form the _Vos_ conjugation remplace _r_ at the end of the infinitive with an _s_ and add an accent onto the _a_,_e_, or _i_ that immediately proceeds it.

 - Vivís => You live.
 - Comprás => You buy.
 - Comés => You eat.

This conjugation only exists in the present indicative and present subjunctive tenses.

There are some irregular verbs

Infinitive | Vos
----------:|:---
       Ser | Sos
