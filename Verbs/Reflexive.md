Reflexive
=========

Used when the subject of the verb is also the object, and in place of passive constructions.

 - Me lavo. => I wash myself.
 - Aquí se venden muchos libros. => Books are sold here (litterally: Here many books sell themselves).

The reflexive pronouns are
- Me => Myself
- Te => Yourself
- Se => Himself, herself, oneself, itself, yourselves, themselves
- Nos => Ourselves

These pronouns follow typical placement; before normal conjugations and negative imperatives, and attached to the end of positive imperatives and gerunds.

    ¿Estrás duchandose? => Are you showering?
    ¡Duérmete! => Go to sleep!


Note: If the reflexive verb is in the infinitive and follows another verb you can place the pronoun before the conjugated verb.

 - Quiero bañarme. / Me quiero bañar. => I want to wash myself
